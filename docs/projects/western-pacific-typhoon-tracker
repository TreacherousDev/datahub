# Project Stormchaser

*Note: To view the full metadata for this project, please see the raw file in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dataengineeringpilipinas/datahub/tree/main/projects).*

## Summary
Project Stormchaser aims to bridge the gap between data and action by providing an interactive visualization tool for understanding typhoon behavior in the western Pacific region. At its core, the app collects typhoon data through web scraping, processes the information, and animates the paths simulated in real time.  Project Stormchaser democratizes access to critical weather information, which is often too technical for ordinary citizens to interpret, by giving them a more intuitive visualization of a typhoonâ€™s movement and intensity. 

## Methodology
Data scraping was done in python using `Beautifulsoup4`. Data about its wind speed, pressire and coordinates at recorded times are collected and arranged into a data structure that gets fed into an animation engine. This engine then runs a simulation that visualizes the typhoon paths in real time.
The map was drawn using `Cartopy`, drawing land and ocean borders, and many other geographical features. `Pygame` was used to render the scene and display visual output, hich are all animated procedurally.
